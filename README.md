# App Idea: Marvel Comic Finder

### Concept
Many people have and are getting into marvel for the first time due to the massively popular cinimatic universe. As more characters are being added and new plotlines are introduced, some people may want to get into the origional source material to take a deeper dive into the marvel universe. However, it can be hard to know where to jump in when there are endless characters with endless different comics. Our idea is to make a platform where users can fill out a questionaire to tell us a little bit about themselves and from there, we recommend them characters and comics they may enjoy.
